# Outlier-Detection
A project outlining some techniques for identifying outliers in a Regression Framework


This project is mostly research-based so there isn't much practical code. The Project 
contains an RMarkdown file with the entire paper and all the hidden code. I recommend reading
the pdf before investigating the .RMD file, as it will give some much-needed context and 
works as a standalone paper.
